# champGG
Downloads item sets from champion.gg to be used with a League of Legends client

The program contains the options to include (or exclude)

Most Frequent Builds, Highest Win% Builds, Starter Items, Consumables and Skill Order


# Setup

1. Click the Download button on the right
2. Extract the files from the zip archive
3. Run champGG.exe

I use nwjs.io to have direct access to node.js from the dom. I provided the exe but if you want to redownload it you can at http://nwjs.io/ (formerly node-webkit). I renamed mine to champGG.exe from nw.exe


# Usage

1. Open the champGG.exe, choose what sets to include, click Download and the program will start downloading the item sets if the champion.gg site can be reached and they haven't changed their code in a way that breaks the app.
2. Copy the folders with champion names from .\ItemSets\Date_AllSets\ to Your_League_Install_Directory\Config\Champions\
3. Play League!

# Will Riot ban me?

According to Reddit: A rioter did this originally, so it's safe. it doesn't affect gameplay, and you're not doing anything you couldn't do manually if you wanted to waste dozens of hours of your life every patch. Go wild!
