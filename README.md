# EXEs are Scary. Can I be sure you aren't hacking me?

Yes you can (well at least from the compiled code issue)

1. visit http://nwjs.io/ and download the version for your operating system.
2. Extract the exe, pak and dat file from the nwjs zip
3. Download and Extract the zip of this repoistory
4. Replace the exe, pak and dat file with the known good files from nwjs.io
