# Can I be sure you aren't hacking me?

Yes you can (well at least from the compiled code)

1. Visit http://nwjs.io/ (formerly node-webkit) and download the version for your operating system.
2. Extract the exe, pak and dat file from the nwjs zip
3. Download and Extract the zip of this repoistory
4. Replace the exe, pak and dat file with the known good files from nwjs.io
5. The rest of the files are html/json and a png image file so you can look and see what's happening
